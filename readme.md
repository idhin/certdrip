# Realtime Certificate Transparency Log Streamer

**certdrip-go** is a real-time domain stream service powered by [Certificate Transparency Logs](https://certificate.transparency.dev/).  
It collects newly issued SSL/TLS certificates and streams extracted domain names over WebSocket, supporting use cases such as:

- Reconnaissance and bug bounty automation
- Threat intelligence pipelines
- OSINT domain monitoring
- Passive DNS & subdomain collection

## üîç Web UI Preview

If you prefer a browser-based view, certdrip-go also includes a **minimal Web UI** to view real-time domains as they appear:

## Features

- Fetches active CT logs dynamically from Chrome‚Äôs official log list
- Concurrent polling of multiple CT logs (via goroutines)
- Real-time WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`)
- Minimalist Web UI on port `8081`
- Domain deduplication with time-based cache
- Rate reporting (domains per second)
- Filters out empty or intermediate certificates

---

## How It Works

1. Fetch usable CT logs from [log_list.json](https://www.gstatic.com/ct/log_list/v3/log_list.json)
2. Each log is polled in a dedicated goroutine
3. Parsed certificates yield Common Name or SAN domains
4. Results are sent to:
   - Console (`stdout`)
   - WebSocket (`ws://localhost:8080/ws`)
   - Web UI (`http://localhost:8081`)
5. Duplicate domains are cached for 5 minutes (configurable)

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or higher
- Docker (optional)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idhin/certdrip.git
cd certdrip

go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

Or run with Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Connect to WebSocket using:

```bash
npx wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

Access Web UI via:

```text
http://localhost:8081
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

You can help by:
- Adding support for new CT endpoints
- Building integrations (Redis, Discord, Kafka, etc)
- Optimizing performance and concurrency
- Improving logging, filtering, or output formatting

Just fork the repo, submit a pull request, or open an issue to get involved.
